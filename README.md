Before importing the database files into MySQL, please note the following:

The program has the following connection string hard coded:

server = localhost; userid = root; password = wali; database = SIMS

Therefore please make sure that you have the following thing taken care of:

1. Name the scheme database as: SIMS
2. Make sure the user ID of your local connection is: root
3. The server name should be: localhost
4. keep the password as: wali
