Amongst our democratic team we all voted to follow the Waterfall Life-Cycle Model also known as the “Classical Model” 
we chose it since it seemed the most straightforward as opposed to the other Life Cycle Models. We also liked the linear aspect 
of the Waterfall Model and also the baseline at the end of every phase makes it clear what we need to have done by then.
